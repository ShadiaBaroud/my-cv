abstract: Warranty is an important part of product marketing that helps both manufacturer
  and customer. From the standpoint of the manufacturer, warranty can help the company
  make more money and improve its reputation. From the customer's perspective, warranty
  is seen as a dependable indicator to quality assurance (QA). The aim of this paper
  is to gain some initial insights on spare part analytics which is important for
  the development of any smart maintenance system in this new industrial era. We do
  this by first focusing on only one important aspect, which is warranty. This results
  in a discussion on some possible challenges that can be adopted in dealing with
  difficult issues related to spare parts warranty such as handling claims during
  the warranty period.
