abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) within Industry 4.0 has
  propelled the evolution of fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies,
  marking a significant shift towards smarter maintenance paradigms in the mechatronics
  sector. With the advent of Industry 4.0, mechatronic systems have become increasingly
  sophisticated, highlighting the critical need for advanced maintenance methodologies
  that are both efficient and effective. This paper delves into the confluence of
  cutting-edge AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL),
  with multi-agent systems (MAS) to enhance fault diagnosis precision and facilitate
  PdM in the context of Industry 4.0. Specifically, we explore the use of various
  ML models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs), and
  DL architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural
  Networks (RNNs), which have been effectively oriented to analyses complex industrial
  data. Initially, the study examines the progress in AI algorithms that accelerate
  fault identification by leveraging data from system operations, sensors, and historical
  trends. AI-enabled fault diagnosis rapidly detects irregularities and discerns the
  fundamental causes, thereby minimizing downtime and enhancing system reliability
  and efficiency. Furthermore, this paper underscores the adoption of AI-driven PdM
  approaches, emphasizing prognostics that predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
  of machinery. This predictive capability allows for the strategic scheduling of
  maintenance activities, optimizing resource use, prolonging the lifespan of expensive
  assets, and refining the management of spare parts inventory. The tangible advantages
  of employing AI for fault diagnosis and PdM are showcased through a case study from
  authentic mechatronics implementations. This case study highlights successful implementations,
  documenting real-world challenges such as data integration issues and system interoperability,
  and elaborates on the strategies deployed to navigate these obstacles. The results
  demonstrate improved operational reliability and cost savings and shed light on
  the pragmatic considerations and solutions that facilitate the adoption of AI and
  MAS in industrial applications. The paper also navigates the challenges and prospective
  research avenues in applying AI within the mechatronics domain of Industry 4.0,
  setting the stage for ongoing innovation and exploration in this transformative
  domain.
